The AS6212 provides a combination of high temperature accuracy with excellent low power consumption using the AS6212 digital temperature sensor from ams AG. The AS6212 measures temperature with &plusmn;0.2&deg;C accuracy between -10&deg;C to 65&deg;C, consumes an average of 6&micro;A (0.1&micro;A in standby) and communicates over I<sup>2</sup>C so naturally we put it on a Qwiic breakout to add to our ever expanding Qwiic system. The sensor boasts a host of features including a configurable alert pin that can trigger when temperature data exceeds user-defined temperature thresholds. All of this in a tiny IC package measuring 1.5mm x 1mm.

The AD0 and AD1 jumpers control the I<sup>2</sup>C address as well as enabling/disabling the Alert pin. By default, these two-way jumpers connect the AD0 pin to Ground and the Alert/AD1 pin to 3.3V to enable the Alert pin and set the I<sup>2</sup>C address to 0x48. These jumpers control the address and enable/disable the Alert pin.
